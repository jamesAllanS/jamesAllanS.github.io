## GUI

1. open caja & hit f3 to split screen
2. have one tab listing home directory - ctrl h to view hidden files
3. open dropbox folder in the other
4. copy **not move** required file across to dropbox
5. rename original config file to something like .config.bak
6. make a link to the file in dropbox folder
7. move the newly created link to home or .config/ as appropriate
8. rename symlink to that of original file:
   * `link to .bashrc` should be `.bashrc`

## CLI

* **Needs Research**
